# Security

This payments service is security-sensitive and should only be deployed in trusted environments with proper network controls and secrets management.

For overall security and privacy guidance (including policy/consent integration and secure profiles), see:

If you believe you have found a security issue in unison-payments, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
